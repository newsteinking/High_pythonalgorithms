Nodes and References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our second method to represent a tree uses nodes and references. In this
case we will define a class that has attributes for the root value, as
well as the left and right subtrees. Since this representation more
closely follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, we will
continue to use this representation for the remainder of the chapter.

Using nodes and references, we might think of the tree as being
structured like the one shown in :ref:`Figure 2 <fig_treerec>`.

   Figure 2: A Simple Tree Using a Nodes and References Approach

We will start out with a simple class definition for the nodes and
references approach as shown in :ref:`Listing 4 <lst_nar>`. The important thing
to remember about this representation is that the attributes ``left``
and ``right`` will become references to other instances of the
``BinaryTree`` class. For example, when we insert a new left child into
the tree we create another instance of ``BinaryTree`` and modify
``self.leftChild`` in the root to reference the new tree.

.. _lst_nar:

**Listing 4**

::

    class BinaryTree:
        def __init__(self,rootObj):
            self.key = rootObj
            self.leftChild = None
            self.rightChild = None
        

Notice that in :ref:`Listing 4 <lst_nar>`, the constructor function expects to
get some kind of object to store in the root. Just like you can store
any object you like in a list, the root object of a tree can be a
reference to any object. For our early examples, we will store the name
of the node as the root value. Using nodes and references to represent
the tree in :ref:`Figure 2 <fig_treerec>`, we would create six instances of the
BinaryTree class.

Next let’s look at the functions we need to build the tree beyond the
root node. To add a left child to the tree, we will create a new binary
tree object and set the ``left`` attribute of the root to refer to this
new object. The code for ``insertLeft`` is shown in
:ref:`Listing 5 <lst_insl>`.

.. _lst_insl:

**Listing 5**

.. highlight:: python
    :linenothreshold: 5

::

    def insertLeft(self,newNode):
        if self.leftChild == None:
            self.leftChild = BinaryTree(newNode)
        else:  
            t = BinaryTree(newNode)
            t.leftChild = self.leftChild
            self.leftChild = t
            
.. highlight:: python
    :linenothreshold: 500

We must consider two cases for insertion. The first case is
characterized by a node with no existing left child. When there is no
left child, simply add a node to the tree. The second case is
characterized by a node with an existing left child. In the second
case, we insert a node and push the existing child down one level in the
tree. The second case is handled by the ``else`` statement on line
4 of :ref:`Listing 5 <lst_insl>`.

The code for ``insertRight`` must consider a symmetric set of cases.
There will either be no right child, or we must insert the node between
the root and an existing right child. The insertion code is shown in
:ref:`Listing 6 <lst_insr>`.

.. _lst_insr:

**Listing 6**

::

    def insertRight(self,newNode):
        if self.rightChild == None:
            self.rightChild = BinaryTree(newNode)
        else:
            t = BinaryTree(newNode)
            t.rightChild = self.rightChild
            self.rightChild = t

To round out the definition for a simple binary tree data structure, we
will write accessor methods (see :ref:`Listing 7 <lst_naracc>`) for the left and right children, as well as
the root values.

.. _lst_naracc:

**Listing 7**

::

    def getRightChild(self):
        return self.rightChild

    def getLeftChild(self):
        return self.leftChild

    def setRootVal(self,obj):
        self.key = obj

    def getRootVal(self):
        return self.key
        

Now that we have all the pieces to create and manipulate a binary tree,
let’s use them to check on the structure a bit more. Let’s make a simple
tree with node a as the root, and add nodes b and c as children. :ref:`ActiveCode 1 <lst_comptest>` creates the tree and looks at the some of the
values stored in ``key``, ``left``, and ``right``. Notice that both the
left and right children of the root are themselves distinct instances of
the ``BinaryTree`` class. As we said in our original recursive
definition for a tree, this allows us to treat any child of a binary
tree as a binary tree itself.

            self.rightChild = None
